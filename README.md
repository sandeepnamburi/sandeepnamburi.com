Edit the file background using the **main.css file**. Try to find a new image that is **horizontally tileable** and **1500 x 500**. Change the background color as the image will only appear at the bottom of the page. 

I've implemented _target="blank"_ on all the links so that they will appear on a new page. Feel free to remove that if necessary.
